   Hi, I'm Maria, a Data Scientist based in Italy, nestled between the vibrant city of Milan and the stunning Italian Alps.

   With over 5 years of experience in Python development, I specialize in LLM-based solutions and Generative AI. Since early 2025, I've been working at Ingo, where I've been designing and deploying production-ready AI systems for customer experience, including conversational voicebots and email assistants. I've beein building end-to-end AI services leveraging multi-agent architectures, RAG pipelines, tool calling, and advanced prompt engineering—integrating with CRM systems, APIs, and custom FastAPI services to deliver reliable, high-quality solutions for complex business needs.

   My earlier career focused on IoT Real-Time Analytics for the Energy & Utilities sector, where I worked with sensor-based, high-frequency time-series data. 

   Outside of work, I'm passionate about hiking, learning to swim, visiting photography exhibitions, and taking Spanish lessons—activities that keep me balanced and inspired.
   
   Feel free to reach out—I'd love to connect!
