Starting something new can be a little overwhelming, and that’s exactly how I felt when I first tackled Amazon Web Services (AWS). But after one month of hands-on experience, I’ve learned a ton of practical lessons that I can’t wait to share. 

In this post, I’ll walk you through my journey and offer a practical overview for anyone just starting out with AWS, based on my own experience diving into the platform. This might also serve as a helpful starting point for those looking for a hands-on project to begin with, just like I did.

To start, I should mention that I came into this with zero experience in AWS or any other cloud services. However, I was eager to learn, and that enthusiasm really drove me to explore the possibilities.

I kicked off my learning by enrolling in the **AWS Cloud Technical Essentials** course on Coursera ([link here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-cloud-technical-essentials)), which is offered directly by AWS. I found it to be an excellent introduction, and I highly recommend it to anyone new to the platform.

As I worked through the course, I decided to challenge myself with a project beyond the scope of the exercises provided. I began working on a straightforward web application that enables users to upload, store images, and run object detection algorithms on them. This project quickly became my hands-on playground, where I could test and solidify the concepts I was learning in real time. I was thrilled to dive into a variety of powerful AWS services, like S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and API Gateway (more on these later), and experiment with how they could come together.

Before we begin, I’d like to address a few key points. 

The implementation described in this post was done with a root account, as account management wasn't my primary focus. However, it’s worth noting that this is not the recommended approach according to AWS guidelines. 

I also used the AWS Management Console for this setup, which is beginner-friendly but less efficient compared to using tools like the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or Software Development Kits (SDKs). While the console is great for learning, it's worth mentioning that it does leave room for human error. 

Additionally, since I’m still learning, some other parts of the implementation may not be the most optimized. But ultimately, the purpose here is to learn, experiment, and share my experiences—mistakes included! Any feedback or suggestions are always welcome.

## Managing Your AWS Budget

Before you dive into the implementation details,  I suggest setting a cost budget right away. AWS offers a free tier for most services, so you can explore and learn without worrying about charges. However, it's easy to accidentally use paid services, so email alerts are a great way to keep track and prevent surprises.

You can set this up through the *Billing and Cost Management* console. 

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s1.png" width="500" />


Scroll down to the *Budgets and Planning* section on the left side, click on *Budgets*, and select *Create budget* to set everything up.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s2.png" width="500" />
<img src="/assets/img/blog/s3.png" width="500" />

All that's left is to set your maximum budget for AWS and enter the email address where you'd like to receive notifications. You can start with a pre-configured AWS template, such as the *Zero spend budget*, which will notify you if your charges exceed $0.01 (above the AWS Free Tier limits). Feel free to customize your budget settings and experiment; it's really simple to do!

And here’s an example of an alert email you'll receive from AWS when your spending exceeds the predefined budget.

## Application Architecture 

The architecture of my application is a typical 3-tier application on AWS, also covered in the course mentioned in the introduction of this post. The architecture consists of:
- **Presentation Layer**: The user interface (HTML) is hosted on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and delivered through Amazon CloudFront for fast, global content distribution.
- **Application Layer**: AWS Lambda handles the application logic, with separate functions dedicated to tasks such as user authentication, uploading images to S3, and running object detection algorithms.
- **Data Layer**: This layer stores and manages the application’s data. In this case, we’re using Amazon S3 to handle the data storage.

I’ve broken down the process into three main parts:

- **Setting Up Basic Username and Password Authentication for a Static Website on S3**
- **Using a Lambda Function to Upload Images to S3**
- **Running Object Detection via Lambda Function**

Now, let’s explore how we can bring this to life on AWS.

## 1. Setting Up Basic Username and Password Authentication for a Static Website on S3

### Set Up an S3 Bucket

In the AWS search bar, search for S3 and navigate to the corresponding console, where you can click on *Create bucket*. You'll be asked to configure some bucket settings, but for this application, you can stick with the default options. 
<img src="/assets/img/blog/s5.png" width="800" />

One important thing to mention is that the *Block all public access* option must remain enabled (this is the default setting) to ensure that the bucket stays private.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s6.png" width="800" />

While S3 offers an option to enable static website hosting after creating the bucket, we’ll skip this feature and instead use AWS CloudFront to serve the website. Typically, combining S3 with CloudFront is considered one of the best solutions for hosting and delivering static content.

CloudFront offers superior flexibility and performance compared to S3 alone. For example, CloudFront reduces latency by using edge locations. S3 buckets are region-specific, meaning that no matter where the user is, the website will always be served from the region where the S3 bucket is located. In contrast, CloudFront ensures that content is delivered from the nearest edge location, speeding up load times and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Upload the index.html to Your S3 Bucket

Now it’s time to upload the HTML file for your website’s frontend to the S3 bucket. Since frontend development isn’t my strong suit, I simply provided ChatGPT with detailed instructions and made a few tweaks to the generated HTML to get it just right.

Once you're happy with your website, go to your S3 bucket, and then simply click on the *Upload* button to start adding your file.

Here’s a sneak peek of the design and layout of my simple website.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s7.png" width="500" />

The website includes also some basic functionalities, such as image preview before uploading.

### Configure a CloudFront Distribution

In the AWS search bar, search for CloudFront and navigate to the corresponding console, where you can click on *Create distribution*.

In this step, we have various configuration options to set up. You need to connect the CloudFront distribution to both the S3 bucket (which will act as the distribution's origin) and the Lambda function for authentication. Let’s break down how to do this.

During the distribution creation, make sure to select the previously created S3 bucket in the *Origin Domain* field.

In the *Origin Access* section, select *Origin access control settings (recommended)*" and click on *Create new OAC* to pick your bucket again. This setup makes sure CloudFront accesses the content securely, while blocking direct S3 access. AWS will remind that you need to update your bucket policy (CloudFront will provide the required policy statement once the distribution is ready, so we’ll handle that later).

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s9.png" width="1000" />

In the *Default Cache Behavior* section, select *Redirect HTTP to HTTPS* to ensure all traffic is securely redirected.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s10.png" width="1000" />

In the *Cache key and origin requests* section, under *Headers* open the dropdown menu, and select *Include the following headers*. Afterward, click *Add header* and input *Authorization*.
Adding the Authorization header to the cache key ensures that CloudFront forwards authenticated requests to your origin, enabling secure access to content that requires authorization.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s11.png" width="800" />

In the *Web Application Firewall (WAF)* section, select *Do not enable security protections*. This configuration works well for our experimental application. Keep in mind that enabling the WAF in AWS comes with an additional cost.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s12.png" width="800" />

Once you're done, click on *Create distribution*. The process may take a few minutes, and you can track the deployment status in the *Distributions* section.

One thing I forgot to do—let's head back to our newly created CloudFront distribution and fix that. Go to the *General* tab, and under *Settings*, we need to update the *Default Root Object* to point to the index.html file in our S3 bucket. To do this, click on *Edit*, and update the field with index.html.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s19.png" width="800" />


Note that we’ve skipped the Function association part for now; we’ll handle that when we create the Lambda function directly.

One last step! Now that the distribution is created, we need to update the permissions in the S3 bucket. Head back to your S3 bucket, click on it, go to *Permissions*, scroll down to *Bucket Policy*, and click *Edit*. Then, copy and paste the appropriate policy. To find it, go to your CloudFront distribution, navigate to *Origins*, click *Edit*, and copy the policy from that section.

~~~json
{
        "Version": "2008-10-17",
        "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::basich-auth-buck2/*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                      "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::640168455928:distribution/EHJPRWNXZJE17"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
      }
~~~

### Create the Lambda Function for Authentication

In the AWS search bar, type Lambda and go to the Lambda console. Then, click on *Create function*. You can stick with the default settings here; just give your function a name and click *Create function* at the bottom. 

For reference, I used Node.js 22 as the runtime.
As I’m not familiar with Node.js, I relied again on ChatGPT to generate and modify the function. The function contains hard-coded credentials, which is not the most secure approach. But for now, we'll keep it as is and revisit it later to implement better security practices.
You can go to the *Code* section, after creating your Lambda function, and copy-paste the code in the index.mjs file.

~~~js
export const handler = async (event) => {
   // Retrieve the CloudFront request object
   console.log("Lambda function invoked");
   const request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
  
   let isAllowedAccess = false;  // Default to false


   // Check if the 'Authorization' header is present
   if (request.headers && request.headers.authorization) {
       const basicAuthHeader = request.headers.authorization[0].value;
      
       // Expected base64-encoded "username:password"
       const authString = "Basic " + Buffer.from("mariadancianu:ADD-PASSWORD-HERE").toString("base64"); // Replace with your username and password


       // Compare the provided auth string with the expected one
       isAllowedAccess = basicAuthHeader === authString;
   }


   // If access is allowed, return the original request (continue processing)
   if (isAllowedAccess) {
       console.log("Access granted.");
       return request;
   }


   // If access is not allowed, return a 401 Unauthorized response with WWW-Authenticate header
   const response = {
       status: '401',
       statusDescription: 'Unauthorized',
       body: JSON.stringify("Access denied! Please provide valid credentials."),
       headers: {
           "www-authenticate": [{ key: "WWW-Authenticate", value: "Basic" }]
       },
   };
   console.log("Access denied. Please provide valid credentials.");
   return response;  // Return 401 Unauthorized response
};

~~~

Next, we need to adjust some permissions for the Lambda function. Head to the *Configuration* tab and click on *Permissions*. Then, click on the *Role name* (this will open a new page). Navigate to the *Trust relationships* tab and click *Edit trust policy*. 

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s13.png" width="800" />

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s14.png" width="800" />

Paste the following policy and click *Update policy*. This policy allows the Lambda function to be assumed by both edgelambda.amazonaws.com (for CloudFront) and lambda.amazonaws.com (for Lambda execution).

~~~json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
    	{
        	"Effect": "Allow",
        	"Principal": {
            	"Service": [
                	"edgelambda.amazonaws.com",
                	"lambda.amazonaws.com"
            	]
        	},
        	"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    	}
	]
}
~~~


Click on *Actions*, then select *Deploy to Lambda@Edge*. Choose your desired CloudFront distribution and set the *CloudFront event* to *Viewer Request*. The distribution will update automatically, and you can check the deployment progress in the Distributions tab. Wait for it to complete.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s16.png" width="800" />

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s17.png" width="800" />


After the deployment finishes, navigate to the *Behaviors* tab in your CloudFront distribution. Click *Edit* and scroll to the bottom. You’ll find the Lambda function association displayed there, as shown in the example below:

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s18.png" width="800" />


Alright, everything should be set up now. Let’s test it! Head to the *General* tab of your CloudFront distribution, copy the *Distribution domain name*, and paste it into a new browser tab. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your content loading as expected.

Your site is (almost) ready to handle image uploads to S3. Authentication ensures that only those with valid credentials can upload content to your S3 bucket, blocking unauthorized users from accessing your database.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/s21.png" width="800" />


Handy Tip: If things aren’t working as expected, especially with permissions (I ran into a few issues with that), disable the Lambda function first. Test CloudFront and S3 separately to ensure the permissions are correct. Once confirmed, re-enable Lambda and test the full workflow to make sure everything functions properly.

As a beginner, I also found the *Test* tab in the Lambda console extremely helpful. It lets you test the function in isolation, making it easier to pinpoint issues with the function itself before diving into more complex workflows.


## 2. Using a Lambda Function to Upload Images to S3

Now, let's move on to creating another Lambda function that is triggered when an image is uploaded via our site. This function will handle saving the image to the S3 bucket.

For this step, we’ll introduce an additional AWS service: the API Gateway. We’ll also leverage Lambda’s option to upload a ZIP file, which will contain our Lambda function and all the necessary packages to run it.

### Package the Lambda function and its dependencies into a ZIP file

I’ve chosen Node.js 22 as the runtime for this Lambda function, and once again, ChatGPT is helping me build it! 

Start by creating a new directory for your Lambda function, and moving to this directory:

~~~bash
mkdir my-lambda-function
cd my-lambda-function
~~~

Next initialize a Node.js project - initialize your project to generate a package.json file:

~~~bash
npm init -y
~~~

Install the AWS SDK since Node.js 22 doesn’t include it by default:

~~~bash
npm install aws-sdk
~~~

Now create your Lambda function file, name it index.js and add the code below. 

~~~js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const bucketName = 'YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE';
  
  try {
    // Parse the base64-encoded image from the event body
    const image = JSON.parse(event.body).body;
    const imageBuffer = Buffer.from(image, 'base64');
    
    // S3 upload parameters
    const params = {
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: `${Date.now()}.png`,  // Unique key using the current timestamp
      Body: imageBuffer,
      ContentType: 'image/png'   // Image MIME type
    };
    
    // Upload the image to S3
    await s3.putObject(params).promise();
    
    // Return a success response
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Image uploaded successfully.' })
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors and return an error response
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'An error occurred while uploading the image.', error: error.message })
    };
  }
};

~~~

Make sure that the project has the following structure: 

~~~
my-lambda-function/
├── index.js        # Lambda function code
├── node_modules/   # Installed dependencies (including aws-sdk)
├── package.json    # Project configuration file
└── package-lock.json  # Auto-generated for dependency management
~~~

Finally , to be able to deploy your Lambda function, create a .zip package containing all the files. 

~~~ bash
zip -r function.zip .  # This includes everything in the current directory
~~~

## 3. Running Object Detection via Lambda Function

In my next post, I’ll walk you through how to implement object detection on the images that we just uploaded to our S3 bucket. We’ll explore how to process these images, run the detection models, and store the results—such as object labels and confidence scores—into a CSV file back in the S3 bucket, all using AWS Lambda functions. 

Stay tuned for a hands-on guide on building this workflow!
