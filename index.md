# Hey there, welcome to my website!

I’m Maria, a Data Scientist living just outside Milan, Italy. For the past 5 years, I’ve been working at [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), an innovative energy monitoring startup based in London. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with an incredible team and tackling some really interesting and complex Data Analytics challenges.

Curiosity drives me, and I’m always on the lookout for new things to learn and experiment with. Right now, I’m deepening my skills through a few online courses, focusing on AWS and Generative AI, while also exploring tools that help boost my productivity (currently, Vim and Bash are my go-to).

When I’m not immersed in data, I enjoy photography, hiking, and playing tennis—passions that keep me balanced and inspired.
