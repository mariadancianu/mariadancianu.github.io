# Hey there, welcome to my website!

I'm Maria, a Data Scientist based near Milan 🇮🇹, with experience building customer-facing LLM systems in production.

From 2019 to 2024, I worked at [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), a London-based energy monitoring startup, where I had the privilege of collaborating with an incredible team on ML-driven energy disaggregation using high-frequency time-series data—tackling some interesting and complex Data Analytics challenges.

Since early 2025, I've been working at [Ingo](https://ingo.it/), an AI-based CX and omnichannel solutions company, developing production LLM assistants for voice, email, and chat. I'm leveraging cutting-edge technologies like agentic AI workflows, API integrations, CRM integrations (e.g., Zendesk), RAG, and more.

Curiosity drives me, and I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn and experiment with. Right now, I'm deepening my **LLM post-training** skills outside of work, focusing on **fine-tuning** and **reinforcement learning** through hands-on projects and courses.

I'm especially excited by cutting-edge technologies and their potential to drive meaningful change. I'm drawn to fields where data is used as a force for good, leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and create a positive impact!

When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy hiking, learning to swim, and taking Spanish lessons—passions that keep me balanced and inspired.
