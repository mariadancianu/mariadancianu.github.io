# Hey there, welcome to my website!

I’m Maria, a Data Scientist living just outside Milan, Italy. Between 2019 and 2024, I’ve been working at [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), an innovative energy monitoring startup based in London. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with an incredible team and tackling some really interesting and complex Data Analytics challenges.

Curiosity drives me, and I’m always on the lookout for new things to learn and experiment with. Lately, I’ve been deepening my skills through online courses, with a strong focus on **AWS** and **Generative AI**. 

In particular, I’m diving into **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, working on building and evaluating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangChain, Hugging Face, and Ragas**. This hands-on experience is helping me refine my understanding of LLM pipelines, retrieval mechanisms, and evaluation frameworks. 

At the same time, I’m exploring tools that enhance my productivity—right now, Vim and Bash are essential in my workflow, allowing me to work more efficiently and streamline my development process.

I'm especially excited by cutting-edge technologies and their potential to drive meaningful change. I’m drawn to fields where data is used as a force for good, leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and create a positive impact!

When I’m not immersed in data, I enjoy photography, hiking, and playing tennis—passions that keep me balanced and inspired.
