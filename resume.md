# Résumé
## Professional Summary
Data Scientist with **5+ years of experience**, specializing in **LLM-based solutions**. One year of hands-on experience designing and deploying production-ready **GenAI systems** in the CX space, including **conversational voicebots** and **email assistants**. Earlier experience focused on IoT real-time analytics.

## Experience
**Data Scientist @ [INGO](https://ingo.it/) (April 2025 - Today)**
- **Generative AI & LLMs**: designed and deployed production-ready AI CX sys- tems, including multi-agent voicebots and email assistants, optimized for low cost and latency leveraging LLMs with tool calling, RAG pipelines and advanced prompt engineering.
- **End-to-end AI services**: developed custom FastAPI services and integrated third-party APIs such as Microsoft Graph, ElevenLabs, Google Drive and CRM systems (i.e. Zendesk) to enable automated CX, document processing, and email orchestration workflows.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: developed client-facing dashboards in Zoho Analyt- ics leveraging complex MySQL queries for service monitoring and data-driven insights.
- **Production Infrastructure**: deployed production services on Linux VMs using PM2 for process monitoring and auto-restart and crontab for automated job scheduling.

**Data Scientist @ [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/) (Sep 2019 - Dec 2024)**

- **Energy Disaggregation**: developed production-ready domestic electrical appli- ance detection models, achieving high accuracy, and using supervised and un- supervised machine learning models.
- **Real Time Analytics**: led the transition from historical to live analytics, re- designing the code stack for real-time results.
- **Internal Tools**: developed Python packages for visualization, data quality checks, semi-automated labeling, and KPI monitoring, improving workflow ef- ficiency.
